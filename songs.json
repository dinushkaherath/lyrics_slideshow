now let us learn,\nHow its growth is fraught with suff'ring,\nMidst environment so stern;\nHow unlike the untamed flowers\nGrowing in the wilderness\nIn a maze of wild confusion,\nMaking patterns numberless.\n\n2\nBut the blossoms of the grape vine\nWithout glory are and small;\nThough they do have some expression,\nThey are hardly seen withal.\nBut a day since they have flowered\nInto fruit the blooms have grown;\nNever may they wave corollas\nWith luxuriant beauty shown.\n\n3\nTo a post the vine is fastened;\nThus it cannot freely grow;\nWhen its branches are extended,\nTo the trellis tied they go.\nTo the stony soil committed,\nDrawing thence its food supply;\nIt can never choose its own way,\nOr from difficulty fly.\n\n4\nOh, how beautiful its verdure,\nWhich in spring spread o'er the field.\nFrom life's energy and fulness\nGrowth abundant doth it yield.\nTill it's full of tender branches\nTwining freely everywhere,\nStretching 'gainst the sky's deep azure\nTasting sweetly of the air.\n\n5\nBut the master of the vineyard\nNot in lenience doth abide,\nBut with knife and pruning scissors\nThen would strip it of its pride.\nCaring not the vine is tender,\nBut with deep, precision stroke\nAll the pretty, excess branches\nFrom the vine are neatly broke.\n\n6\nIn this time of loss and ruin,\nDare the vine self-pity show?\nNay, it gives itself more fully\nTo the one who wounds it so,\nTo the hand that strips its branches,\nTill of beauty destitute,\nThat its life may not be wasted,\nBut preserved for bearing fruit.\n\n7\nInto hard wood slowly hardens\nEvery stump of bleeding shoot,\nEach remaining branch becoming\nClusters of abundant fruit.\nThen, beneath the scorching sunshine,\nLeaves are dried and from it drop;\nThus the fruit more richly ripens\nTill the harvest of the crop.\n\n8\nBowed beneath its fruitful burden,\nLoaded branches are brought low—\nLabor of its growth thru suff'ring\nMany a purposed, cutting blow.\nNow its fruit is fully ripened,\nComforted the vine would be;\nBut the harvest soon is coming,\nAnd its days of comfort flee.\n\n9\nHands will pick and feet will trample\nAll the riches of the vine,\nTill from out the reddened wine-press\nFlows a river full of wine.\nAll the day its flow continues,\nBloody-red, without alloy,\nGushing freely, richly, sweetly,\nFilling all the earth with joy.\n\n10\nIn appearance now the grape vine\nBarren is and pitiful;\nHaving given all, it enters\nInto night inscrutable.\nNo one offers to repay it\nFor the cheering wine that's drunk,\nBut 'tis stripped and cut e'en further\nTo a bare and branchless trunk\n\n11\nYet its wine throughout the winter\nWarmth and sweetness ever bears\nUnto those in coldness shiv'ring,\nPressed with sorrow, pain, and cares.\nYet without, alone, the grape vine\nMidst the ice and snow doth stand,\nSteadfastly its lot enduring,\nThough 'tis hard to understand.\n\n12\nWinter o'er, the vine prepareth\nFruit again itself to bear;\nBudding forth and growing branches,\nBeauteous green again to wear;\nNever murmuring or complaining\nFor the winter's sore abuse,\nOr for all its loss desiring\nIts fresh off'ring to reduce.\n\n13\nBreathing air, untainted, heavenly,\nAs it lifts its arms on high,\nEarth's impure, defiled affections\nNe'er the vine may occupy.\nFacing sacrifice, yet smiling,\nAnd while love doth prune once more,\nStrokes it bears as if it never\nSuffered loss and pain before.\n\n14\nFrom the branches of the grape vine\nSap and blood and wine doth flow.\nDoes the vine, for all it suffered,\nLost, and yielded, poorer grow?\nDrunkards of the earth and wanderers,\nFrom it drink and merry make,\nFrom their pleasure and enjoyment\nDo they richer thereby wake?\n\n15\nNot by gain our life is measured,\nBut by what we've lost 'tis scored;\n'Tis not how much wine is drunken,\nBut how much has been outpoured.\nFor the strength of love e'er standeth\nIn the sacrifice we bear;\nHe who has the greatest suff'ring\nEver has the most to share.\n\n16\nHe who treats himself severely\nIs the best for God to gain;\nHe who hurts himself most dearly\nMost can comfort those in pain.\nHe who suffering never beareth\nIs but empty \"sounding brass\";\nHe who self-life never spareth\nHas the joys which all surpass.","language_links":[5117,8805,8020]},{"id":1573,"title":"Come, ye

During our daily life, we just do not remember that the Lord as another One is with us.
