    1    Oh what a mystery!
    2    Never did I dream before (Hymns, 1238)
    3    I am the living bread
    4    Until we all arrive
    5    Jesus Lord, I’m captured by Thy beauty
    6    I’ve got a river of life
    7    Eat the bread, ye people of the Lord (Hymns, 1108)
    8    Just taste and see (Hymns, 1331)
    9    But we all, but we all with unveiled face
    10    This is the year of Jubilee!
    11    Do come, oh, do come (Hymns, 1151)
    12    Fill my spirit up
    13    I am crucified with Christ
    14    Draw me, dear Lord
    15    I’m so happy here
    16    Jesus, O living word of God
    17    Dearest Lord, You've called us here
    18    Therefore with joy (Hymns, 1340)
    19    Therefore the redeemed (Hymns, 1341)
    20    Christ is the Tree of Life
    21    ’Tis the local church proclaiming (Hymns, 1096)
    22    Manna from heaven came down
    23    Christ is a genuine Man
    24    I come to Thee dear Lord (Hymns, 812)
    25    In this godless age
    26    Pursue Him and know Him
    27    Rekindle!
    28    Recall how David swore (Hymns, 1248)
    29    Growing up together in the Lord
    30    Oh, the church of Christ is glorious (Hymns, 1226)
    31    We will sing to the Lord (Hymns, 1141)
    32    O I’m a man (Hymns, 1293)
    33    Let us eat Jesus every day (Hymns, 1146)
    34    What a victory! What a triumph! (Hymns, 1174)
    35    Down from His glory (Hymns, 82)
    36    God has called us for His purpose
    37    Lord, I just love You (In my heart)
    38    Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing pow’r (Hymns, 1007) 
    39    What can wash away my sin? (Hymns, 1008)
    40    Lord, keep my heart always true to you
    41    There’s a man in the glory (Hymns, 505)
    42    Oh, Come see a Man
    43    Hear the Lord He’s calling onward
